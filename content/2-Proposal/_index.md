# Aurora Time  
## Unified AWS Serverless Solution for Personal Time Management

### 1. Executive Summary  duy ne 
This proposal presents the implementation plan for Aurora Time, a time management application on the AWS platform, simple and focused on scheduling features, to address the complexity and operational costs of current solutions. Aurora Time will leverage AWS serverless and managed services to ensure high scalability, reliability, and cost optimization, delivering rapid return on investment (ROI) through reduced infrastructure management costs.

### 2. Problem Statement  
#### *Current Problem*  
Individuals struggle to manage daily commitments because schedules are scattered (notes, phones) leading to confusion and missed tasks. Current tools are often too complex, overloaded with work features, and unsuitable for the need for quick and simple scheduling in personal life. Aurora Time solves this by providing a centralized, minimalist, and intuitive platform to easily track habits and important milestones.  

#### *Solution*  
The platform uses Amazon S3 combined with Amazon CloudFront to store and distribute web applications, using AWS Amplify for rapid development and deployment. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda serve as the Backend processing layer to handle event CRUD requests. Data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB to ensure fast access speed and low latency. Amazon Cognito ensures secure authentication and authorization for each individual user. Amazon EventBridge and Amazon SES are used to trigger and send scheduled reminder notifications. Similar to other calendar applications, users can create and edit personal schedules, but this platform operates at a more minimalist scale and serves the purpose of daily personal time management. Key features include intuitive scheduling interface, customizable reminders, and low operational costs.  

#### *Benefits and Return on Investment (ROI)*  
The Aurora Time solution creates a solid foundation for individual users to centralize all schedules while providing a cost-saving Serverless architecture model for easy feature expansion. The platform reduces schedule fragmentation and minimizes missed important commitments through a centralized, simple reminder system, simplifying personal time management and improving work/life balance.

Estimated monthly infrastructure costs of $16 - $50 USD, totaling approximately $192 - $600 USD for 12 months (depending on number of users and requests). All development components are based on Serverless, incurring no hardware purchases or 24/7 virtual server rental costs. The payback period is estimated at under 6 months thanks to significant time savings in searching and manually arranging schedules, and the extremely low operational costs of the AWS Serverless architecture.

### 3. Solution Architecture  
The platform applies AWS Serverless architecture to manage personal schedule and event data, with the capability to easily scale from a single user to millions of individual users. API requests are received through Amazon API Gateway and processed by AWS Lambda, while data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB to ensure fast query speed and low latency. Amazon EventBridge handles reminder scheduling logic, triggers Lambda, and sends notifications. AWS Amplify provides an intuitive web/mobile interface, secured by Amazon Cognito to safely manage access permissions for each user.

### 4. Technical Implementation  
*Implementation Phases*  
The project consists of 2 parts — Backend Serverless setup and Frontend User Interface building — each part goes through 4 phases:  
1. *Research and Architecture Design*: In-depth research on DynamoDB Data Modeling for schedules and design of verified AWS Serverless architecture (API Gateway, Lambda, EventBridge). (Timeline: Month 1) 
2. *Cost Calculation and Feasibility Check*: Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate actual Serverless operational costs and verify feasibility of authentication (Cognito) and storage (DynamoDB) flows. (Timeline: Month 1)  
3. *Architecture Adjustment for Cost/Solution Optimization*: Fine-tune Lambda parameters (e.g., memory, timeout) and DynamoDB (e.g., RCU/WCU) to ensure highest cost efficiency and best performance for individual users. (Timeline: Month 2)  
4. *Development, Testing, Deployment*: Program Lambda functions, set up CI/CD Pipeline with CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CloudFormation, and develop Frontend applications (React). Then conduct Beta testing and go live. (Timeline: Month 2-3)  

*Technical Requirements*

### 7. Risk Assessment  
*Risk Matrix*  
- Network disconnection/High latency: Medium impact, medium probability.  
- DynamoDB design error: High impact, medium probability.  
- Serverless costs exceed budget: Medium impact, low probability.
- Reminder system failure: High impact, low probability.

*Mitigation Strategies*  
- Network disconnection/High latency: Optimize Frontend (stored on S3/CloudFront) to ensure fast loading speeds, use Client-side Caching so users can still view recent schedules when network is lost.  
- DynamoDB design error: Conduct strict Proof of Concept (POC) and Load Testing for data models. Use optimized Global Secondary Index (GSI) to avoid querying entire table and minimize RCU/WCU costs.  
- Serverless costs exceed budget: Set up AWS Budgets with proactive alerts (Email/SNS) when spending approaches threshold. Regularly check AWS Cost Explorer and optimize Lambda resources.
- Reminder system failure: Closely monitor EventBridge and Lambda reminder processing through CloudWatch Alarms to detect errors immediately. Implement Retry Logic for critical Lambda functions.

*Contingency Plan*  
- AWS Incident: Since the application is only for individuals, if AWS encounters an incident, the system will be configured to automatically Rollback to the latest code version (via CodePipeline) or re-deploy configuration (via CloudFormation).  
- Data Loss: Set up DynamoDB Backup and Restore at regular intervals to quickly recover event data in case of system failure or user error.
- Cost Issues: Use CloudFormation to restore resource configuration (such as RCU/WCU) to proven low-cost state.

### 8. Expected Results  
*User Experience Improvement*: Provide intuitive scheduling interface and real-time notifications (Real-time notifications) replacing manual note-taking and schedule tracking processes. The system is designed for easy scaling, serving from a single user to millions of individual users.  

*Long-term Value and Reusability*: Create a solid Serverless technical platform that can maintain operation at extremely low costs for many years. This architecture can be reused for personal application projects or other expansion features in the future (e.g., habit tracking, simple personal task management).

*Successful Deployment*: Successfully deploy the entire approved Serverless architecture, including automated CI/CD and core features of Aurora Time within the planned timeframe.
