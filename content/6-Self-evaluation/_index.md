Throughout my internship at **AWS** from **08/09/2025** to **12/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, train, and apply the knowledge acquired at university to a real-world work environment.  
I participated in **developing and deploying a complete Serverless web application on AWS Cloud, including setting up the access flow (Route 53, CloudFront), security (API Gateway, Cognito), backend logic (Lambda, DynamoDB), and automating the deployment process (CloudFormation, CodePipeline).**, thereby improving the following skills: **Serverless Programming (AWS Lambda), Serverless Architecture Design, CI/CD Pipeline Setup (with CloudFormation, CodeBuild), NoSQL Optimization (DynamoDB), and REST API Design (API Gateway).**.  

Regarding my professional conduct, I always strived to complete tasks well, comply with regulations, and actively communicate with colleagues to enhance work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship process, I would like to self-assess based on the criteria below:
